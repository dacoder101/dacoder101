## 👋 Hi there, I'm bobbo :D

I'm a fourteen-year-old intermediate programmer who occasionally opens an IDE to experiment with something new. I have knowledge of various languages and CS concepts. Learn more about me by visiting [my website](https://bobboe.live).

I'm looking forward to the next major project, whenever that will be...

* I'm learning Java and other CS concepts while developing a project, [jlox](https://github.com/bqbbo/jlox-interpreter).
* MySQL and databases are something I'm interested in learning to aid future projects.

Plenty of future goals and projects. I'd like to:

### Projects

My major projects are developed using static web languages and Python. Some other minor projects dabble in other languages like Node.
