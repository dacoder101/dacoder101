# *dacoder101: just another programmer*

**Hello!** I'm surprised you found your way to my GitHub profile! I'm Bobby, a semi-experienced programmer and computer hobbyist who enjoys gaming, music, electronics, and coding. I use Windows 11 as my daily driver, especially for gaming, but I also use Arch Linux for programming with Visual Studio Code and Kali Linux on my machine.

## Experience / Projects

I've been coding for a little under four years. I first started learning website creation with JavaScript, HTML, and some CSS and developed some simple projects in my free time. Today, I've become experienced with web development, a fair amount of Python (my preferred scripting language), and a little bit of Java and C++. My experience also extends to the backend, as I know NodeJS and SQL.

Some of my more notable projects include **[rickin](https://github.com/dacoder101/rickin)** (one of my first complete HTML projects), **[math-game-bot](https://github.com/dacoder101/math-game-bot)** (a Discord bot with an interpreter, revolved around a math game), and some other half-created projects I am currently working on.

You can read more about my projects **[here](https://github.com/dacoder101/dacoder101/blob/main/PROJECTS.md)**.

## Future Goals

Some of my future programming goals include,

* Creating an about-me website
* Creating a functional chat application, similar to Discord
* Finishing my 8-bit CPU on a breadboard, designing a GPU, and creating a basic OS
* Completing the Lox interpreter from Crafting Interpreters
* Perfecting my Arch Linux rice
* Learning ethical hacking
